# The Compelling Platform

_"Build it and they will come !"_ - 1989 movie Field of Dreams.

A _key_ ingredient for success when building a platform is that it must be _compelling_ to use. What makes a platform compelling ?

- The platform is self-service for the overwhelming majority of use cases.
- The platform is composable, containing discrete services that can be used independently.
- The platform does not force an inflexible way of working upon the delivery team.
- The platform is quick and cheap to start using, with an easy on-ramp (e.g. Quick start guides, documentation, code samples)
- The platform has a rich internal user community for sharing
- The platform is secure and compliant by default
- The platform is up to date

A platform should also be more than just software and APIs - it is documentation, and consulting, and support and evangelism, and templates and guidelines.

You must also move away from _project_ as the primary mechanism for funding and staffing delivery of technology. Platform is a _product_, and needs a long-lived and stable team tasked with both build and run.

## Define Platform

_"A platform is a curated experience for the customer of the platform (engineers)"_ - Matthew Skelton.

_"A digital platform is a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced co-ordination."_ - Evan Botcher.

What it is <b>NOT:</b>

- It is not the limited virtualised hosting and locked-down centrally-managed tooling that you already have.
- It is not just OpenShift, Ansible or RHEL by themselves.
- The _fattest_ platform in the world.

The starting point is to _"Use these N services in these ways ..."_ - this is a curated experience.

The _Thinnest Viable Platform_ is a small, curated set of complementary services or patterns used together to simplify and accelerate delivery.

The platform will evolve and its design should meet common team interaction modes.
